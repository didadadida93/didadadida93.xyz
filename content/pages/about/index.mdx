Hi!

My name is <ins>Arief Rohman</ins> - but I like to use `didadadida93` as nickname - and living in Indonesia. I really like <ins>cat</ins> even tho didn't have one, but one day I will raise one. Besides <ins>cat</ins>, I like to `coding` too. I like to code to solve my problem so my life got easier. While making a script, I'm interesting with the <ins>safety</ins> of my code. Since I most likely know how a web page work, sometimes I get anxiety when accessing them cause I don't know if the web page is secure or not, or rather does the web page has malicious code or not. That's why I really curious on how to make the web page more <ins>secure</ins>.
